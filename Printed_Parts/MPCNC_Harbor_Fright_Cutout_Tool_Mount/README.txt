# Summary

Mostly Printed CNC tool mount for the Harbor Fright* 3.5A Electric Cutout Tool.

Should be a solid mount for a cheap tool (<$20 on sale using a coupon).

*FRIGHTful how much 'stuff' I buy from there.

# Print Settings

Printer: i300Pro
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.26mm
Infill: 45%

Notes: 
I used MakerGeeks dishwasher-safe high-temp PLA at 230ÂºC. A bit more flexible that standard PLA, but seems like a solid mount. Initially the top mount was one piece with one split. The PLA I used flexed enough to get around the tool, but standard PLA probably would have broke so redesigned it.

# Post-Printing

Needs seven (7) sets of 6-32 x 3/4" screws with lock nuts--four sets to mount to the tool base, and three sets to hold the tool.

Still assembling my MPCNC, so in theory, the HF cutout tool should work for basic stuff.
